## EIP-4430 Smart Contract Prototype

The "EIP-4430 Smart Contract Prototype" experiment implements a smart contract approach to solving the "metadata" and side-effect descriptions 

### Problem
As a User of Web3 I want my wallet to show me detailed transaction metadata when signing a transaction and/or message.

### Solution
Transactions signing screens with injected side-effect descriptions and input metadata.
